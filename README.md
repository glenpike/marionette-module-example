marionette-module-example
============

A very simple demo of a Backbone Marionette application
using a Module.
The conventional way of defining Modules with Application.module has been deliberately
avoided because we are using RequireJS and want to be able to define modules
without requiring App.
This allows us to unit-test each module in isolation

##TODO

Example unit test and clean up.
